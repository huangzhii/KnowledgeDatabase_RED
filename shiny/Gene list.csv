"1","PIK3CA","H1047L","38.9","false","false","PIK3CA encodes p110-alpha, which is the catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). The PI3K pathway is involved in cell signaling that regulates a number of critical cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival (Samuels et al., 2005; 15950905, Engelman, 2009; 19629070). PIK3CA alterations that have been characterized as activating, such as observed here, are predicted to be oncogenic (Kang et al., 2005; 15647370, Ikenoue et al., 2005; 15930273, Gymnopoulos et al., 2007; 17376864, Horn et al., 2008; 18317450, Rudd et al., 2011; 21266528, Hon et al., 2012; 22120714, Burke et al., 2012; 22949682, Wu et al., 2009; 19915146, Dbouk et al., 2010; 2103068, Dan et al., 2010; 20530683, Oda et al., 2008; 18829572, Zhao and Vogt, 2008; 18794883, Lui et al., 2013; 23619167, Ross et al., 2013; 22430209, Riviere et al., 2012; 22729224, Shibata et al., 2009; 19394761, Droguluk et al., 2015; 26627007). Mutations in PIK3CA have been reported in 25-40% of breast cancer cases (Loi et al., 2013; 23301057, Christgen et al., 2013; 22997091, Ramirez-Ardila et al., 2013; 23592373, Kalinsky et al., 2009; 19671852, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897). Mutations in exon 20 (H1047R) of PIK3CA have been associated with a better prognosis than mutations occurring in exon 9 (E542K, E545K) (Barbareschi et al., 2007; 17947469). Clinical and preclinical data in various tumor types indicate that PIK3CA activating alterations may predict sensitivity to therapies targeting PI3K or AKT (Juric et al., 2014; ESMO Abstract 451PD, Banerji et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2500)(Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574). On the basis of clinical benefit for patients with PIK3CA mutations and preclinical evidence, PIK3CA-mutated tumors may also respond to mTOR inhibitors, including everolimus and temsirolimus (Park et al., 2016; 27105424, Andre et al., 2016; 27091708, Janku et al., 2011; 21216929, Moulder et al., 2015; 25878190, Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Meric-Bernstam et al., 2012; 22422409). Addition of everolimus to exemestane for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer has shown clinical benefit regardless of PIK3CA status (Moynahan et al., 2017; 28183140). In the BELLE-2 trial for patients with endocrine-resistant HR+ breast cancer, the combination of the pan-PI3K inhibitor buparlisib with fulvestrant resulted in increased progression-free survival (PFS; 7.0 vs. 3.2 months) and overall response rate (ORR; 18% vs. 4%) compared to placebo with fulvestrant in patients with PIK3CA mutation; no significant improvement in PFS or ORR was observed in patients without PIK3CA mutation (Baselga et al., 2015; SABCS Abstract S6-01). PI3K-alpha-selective inhibitors, such as alpelisib, may have a bigger therapeutic window than pan-PI3K inhibitors (Baselga et al., 2015; SABCS Abstract S6-01)(Fritsch et al., 2014; 24608574). Alpelisib achieved partial responses (PRs) for 11% of patients with PIK3CA-mutated advanced solid tumors (Juric et al., 2014; ESMO Abstract 451PD). For patients with PIK3CA-mutated advanced HR+ breast cancer, hormone therapy combined with alpelisib or taselisib, a PI3K-beta-sparing selective PI3K inhibitor, has shown promising preliminary efficacy, with ORRs of 6-44% (Janku et al., 2014; SABCS Abstract PD5-5, Mayer et al., 2017; 27126994, Saura et al., 2014; SABCS Abstract PD5-2). Furthermore, CDK4/6 inhibitors may sensitize PIK3CA-mutant breast cancers to PI3K inhibitors (Vora et al., 2014; 25002028). A Phase 1 study of the pan-AKT inhibitor AZD5363 observed responses for 3/15 patients with PIK3CA-mutated HR+ breast cancer (Banerji et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2500). In a Phase 1 trial of the dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitor apitolisib, 79% (11/14) of patients with PIK3CA-mutated advanced solid tumors experienced disease control at the recommended Phase 2 dose (3/14 PRs, 8/14 stable disease)(Dolly et al., 2016; 26787751). Activating mutations in PIK3CA may confer resistance to HER2-targeted therapies; combined inhibition of HER2 and the PI3K pathway may be required in tumors with ERBB2 amplification and PIK3CA mutation (Andre et al., 2016; 27091708, Chakrabarty et al., 2010; 20581867, Kataoka et al., 2010; 19633047, Wang et al., 2011; 21676217, Barbareschi et al., 2012; 22744290).","PIK3CA activating mutations or amplification may lead to activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, and may therefore indicate sensitivity to inhibitors of PI3K, AKT, and/or mTOR.

"2","CD274 (PD-L1)","amplification",NA,"false","false","CD274 encodes the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), also known as B7-H1, which is a cell surface molecule important for regulating the activity of T-cells through binding to various T-cell receptors. Although PD-L1 is a costimulatory molecule for naive T-cells, it can provide inhibitory signals to activated T-cells through interactions with the receptors PD-1 or CD80 (Keir et al., 2008; 18173375, Butte et al., 2007; 17629517). These signals can help PD-L1-expressing tumor cells evade immune detection by natural killer cells or T-cells (Benson et al., 2010; 20460501, Iwai et al., 2002; 12218188, Liu et al., 2007; 17363736). PD-L1 amplification has been reported to be associated with increased expression (Ansell et al., 2015; 25482239, Green et al., 2010; 20628145, Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network., 2014; 25079317). Amplification of CD274 has been reported in 1% of samples in the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897). Amplification of chromosomal fragment 9p24, which includes CD274, has been reported in breast cancer (Wu et al., 2012; 21666724, Han et al., 2008; 18314908). PD-L1 overexpression in breast cancer has been reported in 19-23% of cases and significantly associated with adverse clinic-pathological features (Muenst et al., 2014; 24842267, Hasan et al., 2011; 21870995, Ghebeh et al., 2006; 16611412, Ghebeh et al., 2008; 18294387) and overall survival (Muenst et al., 2014; 24842267). However, in another study, PD-L1 mRNA overexpression was associated with longer disease-free survival (Mittendorf et al., 2014; 24764583). Overexpression of CD274 has also been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in malignant melanoma, colon, pancreatic, hepatocellular, renal cell, and ovarian carcinomas (Gao et al., 2009; 1918816, Hino et al., 2010; 20143437, Geng et al., 2008; 18347814, Nomi et al., 2007; 17404099, Loos et al., 2008; 18486325, Thompson et al., 2004; 15569934, Thompson et al., 2006; 16585157, Hamanishi et al., 2007; 17360651). On the basis of strong clinical evidence, CD274 amplification and PD-L1 overexpression may predict sensitivity to antibodies targeting PD-L1 or PD-1. Patients with high tumor PD-L1 expression across multiple solid tumor types have exhibited improved overall survival with the FDA-approved PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab (Martin-Liberal et al., 2015; ESMO Symposium on Immuno-Oncology Abstract 24P)(Fehrenbacher et al., 2016; 26970723, Herbst et al., 2014; 25428504). Compared with PD-L1-negative patients, clinical studies with the PD-L1 antibody durvalumab have suggested higher response rates for patients with urothelial carcinoma and PD-L1-positive tumor or immune cells (Powles et al., 2017; ASCO Genitourinary Abstract 286)(Massard et al., 2016; 27269937), non-small cell lung cancer and PD-L1-positive tumor cells (Bais et al., 2017; AACR Abstract 3720/5, Garassino et al., 2016; IASLC Abstract PLO4a.03), or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1-positive tumor cells (Segal et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 3011, Rebelatto et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 8033). The PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab have elicited significant clinical responses (Kefford et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 3005, Gröschel et al., 2016; 27900363), including in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, a tumor type that harbors frequent PD-L1 copy number gains (Ansell et al., 2015; ASH Abstract 583)(Ansell et al., 2015; 25482239). Clinical studies reported that PD-L1 amplification (Gröschel et al., 2016; 27900363) or expression (Kefford et al., 2014; ASCO Abstract 3005)(Taube et al., 2014; 24714771) in solid tumors is associated with response to anti-PD-1 antibodies. Furthermore, JAK2 has been reported as important for PD-L1 expression in Hodgkin lymphoma and PMBCL cell lines, and JAK2 inhibition has been reported to decrease PD-L1 transcript accumulation (Green et al., 2010; 20628145, Derenzini et al., 2011; 22829094). Therefore, JAK2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib may also be relevant for a patient with PD-L1 amplification.","CD274 (PD-L1) amplification may promote PD-1 signaling and inhibit the anti-tumor immune response. Antibodies that block the interaction of PD-L1 and PD-1 may therefore be beneficial to release the anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, JAK2 inhibitors may be relevant, because they may reduce PD-L1 expression. Examples of clinical trials that may be appropriate for this patient are listed below.

"3","NF1","rearrangement exon 52",NA,"false","false","NF1 encodes neurofibromin, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that is a key negative regulator of the RAS signaling pathway (Hattori et al., 1991; 1904223). Neurofibromin acts as a tumor suppressor by repressing RAS signaling (Morcos et al., 1996; 8628317). Although this alteration has not been fully characterized and its effect on NF1 function is unclear, similar alterations have been previously reported in the context of cancer, which may indicate biological relevance. Germline mutations in NF1 cause the autosomal dominant disorder neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized in part by increased risk of developing various tumors, including sarcoma, glioma, breast carcinoma, and neuroendocrine and hematological neoplasms (Jett and Friedman, 2010; 20027112, Patil and Chamberlain, 2012; 22240541, Evans et al., 2012; 23036231). Estimates for the prevalence of the disorder in the general population range from 1:2,500 to 1:3,000 (Upadhyaya et al., 1995; 8544190, Williams et al., 2009; 19117870), and in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of NF1 is recommended. NF1 mutations have been reported in 2% of breast tumors (Güran and Safali, 2005; 15588864, Salemis et al., 2010; 19466510). However, in a study of 14 metastatic triple-negative breast cancers, NF1 mutations were found in multiple samples (Craig et al., 2013; 23171949). In the scientific literature, NF1 has been suggested to be a driver gene in breast cancer, with NF1 mutation or deletion reported in more than 40% of breast tumors in one study, and were particularly enriched in HER2-positive and basal breast cancer cases (Wallace et al., 2012; 22851646). Studies have suggested that women with neurofibromatosis type 1, which is associated with germline NF1 mutations, may have an increased risk of breast cancer (Madanikia et al., 2012; 23165953, Wang et al., 2012; 22965642, Güran and Safali, 2005; 15588864, Ceccaroni et al., 2002; 12217765, Jett and Friedman, 2010; 20027112). On the basis of clinical evidence in neurofibromatosis type 1 (Dombi et al., 2016; 28029918) and neurofibromatosis-associated glioma or glioblastoma (Fangusaro et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 10504)(Ameratunga et al., 2016; 26936308) as well as extensive preclinical evidence in several tumor types (Jousma et al., 2015; 25907661, Nissan et al., 2014; 24576830, Jessen et al., 2012; 23221341, Chang et al., 2012; 23221337, See et al., 2012; 22573716), NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors, including the approved therapies cobimetinib and trametinib. A Phase 2 trial of selumetinib reported a disease control rate of 96% (24/25) in pediatric patients with recurrent NF1-associated low-grade glioma, with 10 partial responses and 14 stable diseases (Fangusaro et al., 2017; ASCO Abstract 10504). Loss or inactivation of NF1 may also predict sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, including the approved agents everolimus and temsirolimus, based on limited clinical data (Lim et al., 2016; 26859683, Weiss et al., 2015; 25314964, Janku et al., 2014; 24931142) and strong preclinical data in models of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) (Johannessen et al., 2008; 18164202, Johannessen et al., 2005; 15937108). These and other relevant compounds are being investigated in clinical trials. Limited clinical and preclinical evidence in melanoma suggest that in the context of BRAF mutation, NF1 loss or inactivation may reduce sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors (Whittaker et al., 2013; 23288408, Maertens et al., 2013; 23171796, Nissan et al., 2014; 24576830); data are conflicting on whether NF1 deficiency reduces sensitivity to MEK inhibition in BRAF-mutant melanoma (Catalanotti et al., 2013; 23444215, Whittaker et al., 2013; 23288408, Krauthammer et al., 2015; 26214590, Nissan et al., 2014; 24576830). Although a preclinical study suggests that combined mTOR and MEK inhibition is effective in a model of NF1-deficient MPNST (Malone et al., 2014; 24913553), a Phase 1b trial of a combination of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with solid tumors reported frequent adverse events and was unable to identify a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule for the combination (Tolcher et al., 2014; 25344362). However, it is not known whether these therapeutic approaches would be relevant in the context of alterations that have not been fully characterized, as seen here.","On the basis of clinical evidence and strong preclinical evidence, NF1 inactivation may predict sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.

"4","PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2)","amplification",NA,"false","false","PDCD1LG2 encodes the protein programmed cell death 1 ligand 2 (PD-L2), also known as CD273 or B7-DC, and is essential for T-cell proliferation and interferon production. PD-1 receptor signaling, which can be stimulated by PD-L2, results in 'T-cell exhaustion', a temporary inhibition of activation and proliferation that can be reversed on removal of the PD-1 signal (Keir et al., 2008; 18173375, Butte et al., 2007; 17629517). Amplification of PDCD1LG2 and the adjacent locus CD274, encoding PD-L1, has been reported in 29% of primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) cases, and PDCD1LG2 copy number gain has been reported to correlate with increased PD-L2 protein expression as determined by immunohistochemistry (Twa et al., 2014; 24497532, Shi et al., 2014; 25025450). Amplification of PDCD1LG2 has been reported in 2% of samples in the breast invasive carcinoma TCGA dataset (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897). PD-L2 expression in breast cancer has been associated with younger age at diagnosis, positive lymph node expression, negative ER expression, and disease recurrence at distant sites (Baptista et al., 2016; 26541326). PDCD1LG2 amplification, which is often co-amplified with CD274, may lead to PD-L2 overexpression and predict sensitivity to PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2 antibodies. The PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab have elicited significant clinical responses in several cancer types, including melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma (Robert et al., 2014; 25399552, Weber et al., 2015; 25795410, Larkin et al., 2015; 26027431, Postow et al., 2015; 25891304, Topalian et al., 2014; 24590637, Brahmer et al., 2015; 26028407, Borghaei et al., 2015; 26412456, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25704439, Motzer et al., 2015; 26406148), and Hodgkin lymphoma, which harbors frequent PD-L2 copy number gains (Ansell et al., 2015; ASH Abstract 583)(Ansell et al., 2015; 25482239). The PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab does not block interaction between PD-1 and PD-L2; however, multiple clinical studies with atezolizumab have reported an association between increased PD-L2 expression and response or improved overall survival in multiple solid tumor types, thereby suggesting that PD-L2 overexpression may serve as a biomarker of response (Schmid et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 11506)(Herbst et al., 2014; 25428504, Fehrenbacher et al., 2016; 26970723).

"5","AKT2","amplification",NA,"false","false","AKT2 encodes an intracellular serine/threonine kinase that is also known as PKB-beta. AKT2 is one of three members of the AKT gene family, and activation of AKT2 has been implicated in multiple malignancies (Liu et al., 1998; 9679957, Vivanco and Sawyers., 2002; 12094235). AKT isoforms appear to have different roles in tumorigenesis; AKT1 appears to contribute to tumor initiation, whereas AKT2 promotes invasion and metastasis in breast tumors (Chin and Toker., 2011; 21519185). Although AKT2 amplification has been reported to associate with AKT2 overexpression (Cheng et al., 1992; 1409633, Thompson et al., 1996; 8646743, Altomare and Testa., 2005; 16288292), studies in various cancers suggest that AKT2 phosphorylation may have greater clinical relevance than AKT2 amplification or mRNA overexpression (Cicenas., 2008; 18409144, Scrima et al., 2012; 22363436). In the Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA dataset, putative high-level amplification of AKT2 has been reported in 2.2% of cases (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897); a similar incidence of 2.8% has been reported in the scientific literature (Bellacosa et al., 1995; 7657393). Although AKT2 amplification has been reported to be rare in breast cancer, preclinical studies suggest that it may be associated with increased tumor invasion and metastasis (Bellacosa et al., 1995; 7657393, Chin and Toker, 2011; 21519185). However, AKT2 expression has been found to be associated with reduced risk of distant recurrence in patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (Fohlin et al., 2013; 23305873). Amplification or activation of AKT2 may promote AKT-mTOR pathway activation and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of the AKT and downstream mTOR pathways. AKT inhibitors are in clinical trials in various tumor types and mTOR inhibitors have been FDA approved in breast cancer and other tumor types (Baselga et al., 2012; 22149876). Vandetanib and everolimus combination treatment demonstrated intracranial activity in a patient with RET-rearranged and AKT2-amplified metastatic NSCLC (Subbiah et al., 2015; 25982012) and a patient with AKT2-amplified triple-negative breast cancer achieved a complete response to a combination of a rapalog mTOR inhibitor, bevacizumab and doxorubicin (Basho et al., 2017; 27893038). In preclinical studies, the AKT inhibitor MK-2206 showed evidence of enhancing anti-tumor activity of other chemotherapeutic agents in lung and ovarian tumor cells (Hirai et al., 2010; 20571069). In addition, a preclinical study in breast and ovarian cancer cells correlated AKT2 activation with resistance to docetaxel (Xing et al., 2008; 18171600).","AKT2 amplification may lead to AKT-mTOR pathway activation and may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway.

ARID1A missense mutations are mostly uncharacterized, whereas several in-frame insertions or deletions, such as Q1334_R1335insQ and A343_A348>A, have been shown to impair ARID1A tumor suppressor activity without affecting ARID1A protein levels (Guan et al., 2012; 23097632).   ARID1A alterations are particularly prevalent in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (46-57%), ovarian and uterine endometrioid carcinomas (24-44%), and cholangiocarcinoma (36%); they are also reported in up to 27% of gastric carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, pediatric Burkitt lymphoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma (CRC), and urothelial carcinoma samples analyzed (COSMIC, cBioPortal, 2017)(Wu et al., 2014; 24618703, Jones et al., 2012; 22009941, Dulak et al., 2013; 23525077, Streppel et al., 2013; 23318448, Jiao et al., 2014; 24293293, Ross et al., 2014; 24563076). Low ARID1A expression has been associated with advanced tumor stage in breast carcinoma, although studies are conflicted over the role of ARID1A loss as an independent predictor of overall survival (Zhang et al., 2012; 21889920, Mamo et al., 2012; 21892209, Zhao et al., 2014; 24430365). ARID1A loss is associated with microsatellite instability in ovarian and endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinomas (Huang et al., 2014; 25195947, Hussein et al., 2014; 25394778, Bosse et al., 2013; 23702729, Allo et al., 2014; 23887303), CRC (Chou et al., 2014; 24925223, Ye et al., 2014; 25311944, Wei et al., 2014; 25561809), and gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2015; 25583476, Wang et al., 2011; 22037554, Abe et al., 2012; 22915242, Wang et al., 2012; 22808142, Wiegand et al., 2014; 24767857).   There are no therapies approved to address the mutation or loss of ARID1A in cancer. However, on the basis of limited preclinical evidence from studies in ovarian cancer, ARID1A inactivation may predict sensitivity to inhibitors of EZH2 (Bitler et al., 2015; 25686104, Kim et al., 2015; 26552009), which are under investigation in clinical trials. Other studies have reported that loss of ARID1A may activate the PI3K-AKT pathway and be linked with sensitivity to inhibitors of this pathway (Wiegand et al., 2014; 24559118, Huang et al., 2014; 24336158, Samartzis et al., 2014; 24979463). Loss of ARID1A expression has been associated with chemoresistance to platinum-based therapy in patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (Yokoyama et al., 2014; 24459582, Katagiri et al., 2012; 22101352) and to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in CRC cell lines (Xie et al., 2014; 24833095).",NA
"7","Microsatellite status","MS-Stable",NA,"false","false","Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a condition of genetic hypermutability that generates excessive amounts of short insertion/deletion mutations in the genome; it generally occurs at microsatellite DNA sequences and is caused by a deficiency in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) in the tumor (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). Defective MMR and consequent MSI occur as a result of genetic or epigenetic inactivation of one of the MMR pathway proteins, primarily MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2 (You et al., 2010; 21081928, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942). The tumor seen here is microsatellite-stable (MSS), equivalent to the clinical definition of an MSS tumor: one with mutations in none of the tested microsatellite markers (Boland et al., 1998; 9823339, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). MSS status indicates MMR proficiency and typically correlates with intact expression of all MMR family proteins (Kocarnik et al., 2015; 26337942, Bairwa et al., 2014; 24623249, Pawlik et al., 2004; 15528785, Boland and Goel, 2010; 20420947). The frequency of MSI in breast cancer varies widely due to differences in patient characteristics and sample size. In a few studies of Lynch syndrome-related breast cancer patients with small sample sizes (n<10), MSI was observed in 60%-85% of patients (Risinger et al., 1996; 8646682, De Leeuw et al., 2003; 12615735, Shanley et al., 2009; 19123071, Buerki et al., 2012; 22034109, Yee et al., 1994; 8137273). However, no MSI was observed in a few larger scale analysis of breast cancer samples (Adem et al., 2003; 14520695; Anbazhagan et al., 1999; 10213220). Moreover, MSI was reported in 51% of patients with MMR deficient breast cancer (Walsh et al., 2010; 20215533). Furthermore, a prospective study observed increased MSI following chemotherapy treatment, and MSI is associated with incidence of secondary tumors (Kamat et al., 2012; 22928966). On the basis of clinical evidence, MSS tumors are significantly less likely than MSI-H tumors to respond to anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (Gatalica et al., 2014; 25392179, Kroemer et al., 2015; 26140250, Lal et al., 2015; 25949894), including approved therapies nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255). In a retrospective analysis of 361 patients with solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab, 3% were MSI-H and experienced a significantly higher ORR compared with non-MSI-H cases (70% vs. 12%, p=0.001) (Ayers et al., ASCO-SITC 2016; Abstract P60). Pembrolizumab therapy resulted in a significantly lower objective response rate (ORR) in MSS colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with MSI-H CRC (0% vs. 40%)(Le et al., 2015; 26028255). Similarly, a clinical study of nivolumab, alone or in combination with ipilimumab, in patients with CRC reported a significantly higher response rate in patients with MSI-H tumors than those without (Overman et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 3501).",NA
"8","TP53","P177R","18.9","false","false","Functional loss of the tumor suppressor p53, which is encoded by the TP53 gene, is common in aggressive advanced cancers (Brown et al., 2009; 19935675). Any alteration that results in the disruption or partial or complete loss of the region encoding the TP53 DNA-binding domain (DBD, aa 100-292) or the tetramerization domain (aa 325-356), such as observed here, is thought to dysregulate the transactivation of p53-dependent genes and is predicted to promote tumorigenesis (Joerger and Fersht, 2008; 18410249, Kato et al., 2003; 12826609, Kamada et al., 2011; 20978130). Germline mutations in TP53 are associated with the very rare disorder Li-Fraumeni syndrome and the early onset of many cancers (Bougeard et al., 2015; 26014290, Sorrell et al., 2013; 23355100, Nichols et al., 2001; 11219776, Taubert et al., 1998; 10780879, Kleihues et al., 1997; 9006316, Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208). Estimates for the prevalence of germline TP53 mutations in the general population range from 1:5,000 (Lalloo et al., 2003; 12672316) to 1:20,000 (Gonzalez et al., 2009; 19204208), and in the appropriate clinical context, germline testing of TP53 is recommended. TP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in breast cancer and mutations in this gene have been identified in 27-37% of breast carcinoma samples (cBio-Banerji et al., 2012; 22722202, cBio-Stephens et al., 2012; 22722201, Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897). TP53 mutations that are located within the region encoding the DNA binding domain are associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer (Alsner et al., 2008; 18465328, Olivier et al., 2006; 16489069, Végran et al., 2013; 23359294). TP53 mutation is also implicated in breast cancer susceptibility, as TP53 mutation carriers have an 18-60 fold increased risk for early onset breast cancer (Walsh et al., 2006; 16551709, Garber and Offit, 2005; 15637391, Apostolou and Fostira, 2013; 23586058). There are no approved therapies to address TP53 mutation or loss. However, tumors with TP53 loss of function alterations may be sensitive to the WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 (Hirai et al., 2010; 20107315, Bridges et al., 2011; 21799033, Rajeshkumar et al., 2011; 21389100, Osman et al., 2015; 25504633), therapies that reactivate mutant p53 such as APR-246 (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571)(Lehmann et al., 2012; 22965953, Mohell et al., 2015; 26086967, Franssonet al., 2016; 27179933), or p53 gene therapy and immunotherapeutics such as SGT-53 (Xu et al., 2002; 12489850, Xu et al., 2001; 11713371, Camp et al., 2013; 23470564, Kim et al., 2015; 25240597, Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628) and ALT-801 (Hajdenberg et al., 2012; ASCO Abstract e15010). In a Phase 1 study, AZD1775 in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin elicited partial response in 10% (17/176) and stable disease in 53% (94/176) of patients with solid tumors; the response rate was 21% (4/19) in patients with TP53 mutations versus 12% (4/33) in patients who were TP53-wild-type (Leijen et al., 2016; 27601554). Combination of AZD1775 with paclitaxel and carboplatin achieved significantly longer progression-free survival than paclitaxel and carboplatin alone in patients with TP53-mutant ovarian cancer (Oza et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 5506). Furthermore, AZD1775 in combination with carboplatin achieved a 27% (6/22) response rate and 41% (9/22) stable disease rate in patients with TP53-mutant ovarian cancer refractory or resistant to carboplatin plus paclitaxel (Leijen et al., 2015; ASCO Abstract 2507). In a Phase 1b trial in patients with p53-positive high-grade serous ovarian cancer, APR-246 combined with carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin achieved a 52% (11/21) response rate and 100% disease control rate (Gourley et al., 2016; ASCO Abstract 5571). In a Phase 1b clinical trial of SGT-53 in combination with docetaxel in patients with solid tumors, 75% (9/12) of evaluable patients experienced clinical benefit, including two confirmed and one unconfirmed partial responses and two instances of stable disease with significant tumor shrinkage (Pirollo et al., 2016; 27357628). Additionally, the combination of a CHK1 inhibitor and irinotecan reportedly reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival in a TP53 mutant, but not TP53 wild-type, breast cancer xenotransplant mouse model (Ma et al., 2012; 22446188). Kevetrin has also been reported to activate p53 in preclinical studies and might be relevant in the context of mutant p53 (Kumar et al., 2012; AACR Abstract 2874). Clinical trials of these agents are under way for some tumor types for patients with a TP53 mutation.",NA
"9","Tumor Mutation Burden","TMB-Low",NA,"false","false","Tumor mutation burden (TMB, also known as mutation load) is a measure of the number of somatic protein-coding base substitution and insertion/deletion mutations occurring in a tumor specimen. TMB is affected by a variety of causes, including exposure to mutagens such as ultraviolet light in melanoma (Pfeifer et al., 2005; 15748635, Hill et al., 2013; 23875803) and cigarette smoke in lung cancer (Pfeifer et al., 2002; 12379884, Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070), mutations in the proofreading domains of DNA polymerases encoded by the POLE and POLD1 genes (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Briggs and Tomlinson, 2013; 23447401, Heitzer and Tomlinson, 2014; 24583393, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919), and microsatellite instability (MSI) (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013; 23636398, Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012; 22810696, Roberts and Gordenin, 2014; 25568919). The tumor seen here harbors a low TMB. Compared to patients with tumors harboring higher TMB levels, patients with tumors harboring low TMB levels have experienced lower rates of clinical benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-CTLA-4 therapy in melanoma (Snyder et al., 2014; 25409260), anti-PD-L1 therapy in urothelial carcinoma (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546), and anti-PD-1 therapy in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer (Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Le et al., 2015; 26028255). The Breast Invasive Carcinoma TCGA analysis reported an average (non-silent) mutation load of 0.84 mutations per megabase (muts/Mb) for Luminal A tumors, 1.38 muts/Mb for Luminal B tumors, 2.05 muts/Mb for HER2-enriched tumors, and 1.68 muts/Mb for Basal-like tumors (Cancer Genome Atlas Network., 2012; 23000897). In estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, increased mutation load (> mean of 1.25 muts/Mb) associated with shorter overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) of 2.02] in an analysis of the TCGA data (Haricharan et al., 2014; 24839032). In another study, the number of mutated genes associated with higher tumor grade (Budczies et al., 2015; 27499907). Although the number of mutated genes did not correlate with overall survival by multivariate analysis, cases with 22 or more mutated genes had significantly worse overall survival than cases with fewer than 22 mutated genes (HR of 4.6)(Budczies et al., 2015; 27499907). On the basis of emerging clinical evidence, increased TMB may be associated with greater sensitivity to immunotherapeutic agents, including anti-CTLA-4 (Snyder et al., 2014; 25409260), anti-PD-L1  (Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546, Johnson et al., 2016; 27671167, Balar et al., 2017; 27939400), and anti-PD-1 therapies (Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Dong et al., 2016; 28039262); FDA-approved agents include ipilimumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab. In multiple solid tumor types, higher mutational burden has corresponded with response and improved prognosis. Pembrolizumab improved progression-free survival (14.5 vs. 3.4-3.7 months) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and higher mutational load (greater than 200 nonsynonymous mutations; hazard ratio = 0.19)(Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070). In studies of patients with either NSCLC or colorectal cancer (CRC), patients whose tumors harbor elevated mutational burden reported higher overall response rates to pembrolizumab (Rizvi et al., 2015; 25765070, Le et al., 2015; 26028255, Dong et al., 2016; 28039262). Anti-PD-1 therapies have achieved clinical benefit for certain patients with high mutational burden, including 3 patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma who reported sustained partial responses following treatment with pembrolizumab (Mehnert et al., 2016; 27159395) or nivolumab (Santin et al., 2016; 27486176), a patient with hypermutant glioblastoma who obtained clinical benefit from pembrolizumab (Johanns et al., 2016; 27683556), and two pediatric patients with biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD)-associated ultrahypermutant glioblastoma who experienced clinically and radiologically significant responses to nivolumab (Bouffet et al., 2016; 27001570). In patients with melanoma, mutational load was associated with long-term clinical benefit from ipilimumab (Snyder et al., 2014; 25409260, Van Allen et al., 2015; 26359337) and anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 treatments (Johnson et al., 2016; 27671167). For patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, those who responded to atezolizumab treatment had a significantly increased mutational load (12.4 muts/Mb) compared to nonresponders (6.4 muts/Mb)(Rosenberg et al., 2016; 26952546), and mutational load of 16 muts/Mb or higher was associated with significantly longer overall survival (Balar et al., 2017; 27939400).",NA

Amplification of ZNF703 has been correlated with protein expression (Holland et al., 2011; 21337521, Sircoulomb et al., 2011; 21328542). ZNF703 was established as a breast cancer oncoprotein by studies showing that ZNF703 expression resulted in transformation and increased proliferation of cultured cells (Holland et al., 2011; 21337521, Slorach et al., 2011; 21317240, Sircoulomb et al., 2011; 21328542), as well as increased lung metastases in a breast cancer xenograft model (Slorach et al., 2011; 21317240). Amplification of ZNF703 has been observed in luminal B breast tumors, a subtype associated with aggressive disease progression and poor patient outcomes (Holland et al., 2011; 21337521, Sircoulomb et al., 2011; 21328542, Reynisdottir et al., 2013; 24156016), and high expression of ZNF703 has been correlated with reduced survival (Sircoulomb et al., 2011; 21328542, Reynisdottir et al., 2013; 24156016).
